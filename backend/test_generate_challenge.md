## What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. **Image Generation**: Sends an enhanced prompt to DALL-E 3 to generate a bright, cartoon-style illustration with:
   - Disney/Pixar-like animation aesthetic
   - Bold outlines and flat colors
   - Child-friendly cartoon style
   - Clearly separated silly elements that are easy to spot

2. **Vision Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o Vision to analyze the cartoon image and identify:
   - Silly/absurd objects with precise bounding boxes
   - Child-friendly explanations for why each object is silly
   - Appropriate difficulty level based on the number of objects
   - Focus on exaggerated cartoon elements with bright colors

3. **Database Storage**: Saves the challenge to the PostgreSQL database using the existing `Games.create_silly_image_challenge/1` function.

## Error Handling

The task includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing OpenAI API key
- Network failures
- Invalid API responses
- JSON parsing errors
- Database validation errors

## Integration with Flutter App

Once generated, the challenge can be accessed in your Flutter app using:
```dart
SillyThingGameScreen(challengeId: '123')
```

The challenge ID will be printed in the CLI output for easy reference.
